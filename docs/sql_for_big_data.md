### How Google BigQuery Ensures Data Consistency and Integrity in High-Throughput Data Processing on Cloud Storage

Google BigQuery is an efficient and powerful tool for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in distributed file systems and cloud storage. To ensure data consistency and integrity while handling high-throughput data processing on cloud storage, Google BigQuery employs various mechanisms related to transaction management, ACID compliance, and data consistency.

#### Transaction Management and ACID Compliance in Google BigQuery

- **Transactional Semantics**: Google BigQuery supports atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) properties to ensure data integrity and reliability during query processing.
  
- **Distributed Locking**: BigQuery employs distributed locking mechanisms to manage transactions across distributed datasets. This ensures that transactions are executed atomically and prevent conflicts between concurrent queries.

- **Snapshot Isolation**: BigQuery uses snapshot isolation to provide consistent query results by isolating transactions from each other. This mechanism ensures that every query sees a consistent view of the dataset at a specific point in time.

- **Data Replication**: Google BigQuery replicates data across multiple locations to provide redundancy and fault tolerance. This replication helps in ensuring durability and data integrity even in the case of failures.

#### Follow-up Questions

### What measures does Google BigQuery take to prevent data corruption, loss, or skew in high-velocity data processing scenarios?
