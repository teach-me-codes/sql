Here's how these elements contribute to the relevance ranking in Full-Text Search:

#### Relevance Ranking Components:
- **Term Frequency (TF)**
  - Term Frequency measures how often a term appears in a document. It indicates the importance of a term within the document.
  - Mathematically, the Term Frequency for a term $t$ in a document $d$ is calculated as:
    
    $$ TF(t, d) = \frac{\text{Number of times term t appears in document d}}{\text{Total number of terms in document d}} $$
    
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**
  - Inverse Document Frequency evaluates how unique a term is across the entire document corpus. Terms that are rare across documents receive a higher IDF score.
  - The IDF score for a term $t$ in a document corpus is computed as:

    $$ IDF(t) = \log\left(\frac{\text{Total number of documents}}{\text{Number of documents containing term t}}\right) $$

- **TF-IDF Weighting**
  - TF-IDF combines the Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to determine the importance of a term in a document relative to the entire corpus.
  - The TF-IDF score is calculated as the product of TF and IDF:

    $$ TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \times IDF(t) $$

- **Proximity Matching**
  - Proximity Matching takes into account the closeness of terms in a document. It enhances the accuracy and precision of search results by considering the proximity or nearness of terms in the text.
  - By analyzing the distance between terms or phrases in a document, Full-Text Search algorithms can better understand the context and relevance of the content.

In summary, Full-Text Search algorithms utilize relevance ranking based on TF, IDF, TF-IDF weighting, and proximity matching to evaluate and rank search results accurately.
