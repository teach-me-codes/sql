In the SQL:2003 standard, recursive queries allow for generating complex queries by referring to the same table in a recursive manner. These queries facilitate the traversal of hierarchical data structures, enabling efficient representation and querying of relationships such as organizational hierarchies, file systems, bill of materials, and more. The recursive nature of these queries allows for processing data with parent-child relationships or interconnected nodes within the same table.

A recursive query in SQL:2003 typically consists of two essential components:
- **Anchor Member**: The base case or starting point of the recursion.
- **Recursive Member**: The recursive part that refers back to the query itself to build the result iteratively.

The structure of a recursive query in SQL is defined using the `WITH` clause, commonly known as Common Table Expressions (CTE). This feature allows for defining recursive queries in a clear and readable manner.

The recursive query syntax in SQL:2003 can be represented as follows:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
    -- Anchor member
    SELECT ...
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive member
    SELECT ...
    FROM cte_name
    WHERE ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

This recursive query structure entails an initial select statement representing the anchor member and subsequent select statements within the CTE, referring back to `cte_name` in a recursive manner until the desired hierarchy is traversed or a termination condition is met.
