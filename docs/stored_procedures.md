1. **Error Handling in Stored Procedures**:
   - Stored Procedures utilize structured exception handling to manage errors effectively during database operations.
   - The `TRY...CATCH` block is commonly used to handle exceptions in SQL Server's T-SQL.
   - Within the `TRY` block, the SQL operations are performed, and if an error occurs, it is caught in the `CATCH` block for appropriate handling.
   - By using `RAISEERROR`, developers can raise custom error messages when specific conditions are met, providing detailed feedback.

2. **Transaction Management**:
   - Transactions in Stored Procedures ensure the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of database transactions.
   - They allow a group of operations to be treated as a single unit of work, either all succeeding or all failing.
   - The `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` statements are essential for managing transactions in Stored Procedures.
   - `BEGIN TRANSACTION` initiates a new transaction, `COMMIT` saves the operations to the database, and `ROLLBACK` undoes any changes if an error occurs.
   - Transaction isolation levels like `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, and `SERIALIZABLE` control how transactions interact with each other, ensuring data consistency.

### Follow-up Questions:

#### What are the Common Error Handling Techniques Used in Stored Procedures?

- **TRY...CATCH Block**: 
  - The `TRY` block contains the main transaction code, and the `CATCH` block catches and handles any exceptions.
  - It allows for graceful error handling and ensures that the transaction state is consistent.
  
- **RAISEERROR Function**:
  - Used to generate custom user-defined errors with specified error numbers, severity levels, and custom error messages.
  - Enables developers to communicate detailed information about errors to users or log them for later analysis.

- **@@ERROR and @@ROWCOUNT**:
  - `@@ERROR` provides the error number for the last T-SQL statement executed, helping to check for errors.
  - `@@ROWCOUNT` returns the number of rows affected by the last statement, useful for validating the success of operations.

#### How do Transactions in Stored Procedures Ensure the ACID Properties of Database Transactions?

- **Atomicity**:
  - Transactions in Stored Procedures ensure that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully (`COMMIT`) or fully rolled back (`ROLLBACK`) if an error occurs, maintaining atomicity.

- **Consistency**:
  - By grouping related operations into a transaction, Stored Procedures help maintain data consistency, ensuring that data remains valid before and after the transaction.

- **Isolation**:
  - Transaction isolation levels in Stored Procedures govern how concurrent transactions interact, preventing interference between transactions and preserving data integrity.

- **Durability**:
  - Once a transaction is committed in a Stored Procedure, the changes are permanently saved in the database, even in the event of a system failure.

#### Can You Explain the Role of SAVEPOINTs and Nested Transactions in Managing Complex Database Operations within Stored Procedures?

- **SAVEPOINTs**:
  - SAVEPOINTs allow for creating predefined points within a transaction to which you can roll back without affecting the entire transaction.
  - They provide a way to divide a transaction into smaller segments and perform partial rollbacks if needed, enhancing flexibility in error handling.

- **Nested Transactions**:
  - Nested transactions involve starting a new transaction within an existing transaction.
  - They offer a hierarchical approach to transaction management, where changes made within the nested transaction can be committed or rolled back independently of the outer transaction.
  - Nested transactions can be valuable in complex database operations where you need to manage changes at different levels of granularity.

In conclusion, Stored Procedures play a vital role in maintaining data integrity through robust error handling mechanisms and transaction management procedures, ensuring the reliability and consistency of database operations.
