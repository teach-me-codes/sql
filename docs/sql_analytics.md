  - *Definition*: Inner joins retrieve records that have matching values in both tables based on the specified join condition.
  - *Impact on Query Results*:
    - Only the rows with matching values in both tables are included in the result set.
    - Inner joins produce a result set that contains data common to both tables.
  - *Code Example*:
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM table1
    INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
    ```

- **Outer Joins**:
  - *Definition*: Outer joins include unmatched rows from one or both participating tables in the result set.
  - *Impact on Query Results*:
    - **Left Outer Join**:
      - Includes all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
    - **Right Outer Join**:
      - Includes all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
    - **Full Outer Join**:
      - Includes all rows when there is a match in either table.
  - *Code Example*:
    ```sql
    -- Left Outer Join
    SELECT * 
    FROM table1
    LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
    
    -- Right Outer Join
    SELECT * 
    FROM table1
    RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
    
    -- Full Outer Join
    SELECT * 
    FROM table1
    FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
    ```

### Follow-up Questions:

  - Matches rows from the left table based on the join condition.
  - Unmatched rows from the left table will have NULL values in the result set.
  - Useful for retrieving all records from the right table and matching entries from the left table.

#### How Do Left and Right Outer Joins Influence Join Cardinality in SQL Queries?

- **Join Cardinality** refers to the number of rows returned by a join operation.
- In a **Left Outer Join**:
  - The cardinality is at least the same as the left table.
  - If there are no matching rows in the right table, the result set will contain NULL values from the right table.
- In a **Right Outer Join**:
  - The cardinality is at least the same as the right table.
  - If there are no matching rows in the left table, the result set will contain NULL values from the left table.

#### Provide Examples of Scenarios Where Full Outer Joins or Self Joins Are More Suitable Than Inner Joins for Data Consolidation and Analysis.

- **Full Outer Join**:
  - **Scenario**: Merging two datasets from different sources where you want to retain all records, even if there are no matches.
  - This is useful when you need to combine data comprehensively from both tables, regardless of matching conditions.

- **Self Join**:
  - **Scenario**: Hierarchical data structures like organizational charts where you need to compare records within the same table.
  - Helps in comparing records within the same table to identify relationships or hierarchical structures.

#### How Can Join Conditions and Filter Criteria Impact the Performance of Different Join Operations in SQL Analytics?

- **Join Conditions**:
  - **Optimized Join Conditions**: Using indexed columns in join conditions can improve join performance.
  - **Complex Join Conditions**: Complex conditions may impact performance negatively, especially if they involve functions or non-indexed columns.
