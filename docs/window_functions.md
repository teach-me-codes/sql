## Answer

### What are Window Functions in SQL and How are They Used in Advanced Queries?

Window Functions in SQL are a powerful feature that allows performing calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. They operate within a defined window or subset, which makes them distinct from traditional aggregate functions. Window Functions are commonly used for tasks such as ranking, running totals, moving averages, and cumulative sums in SQL queries.

In SQL, Window Functions are specified using the `OVER()` clause, which defines the window or partition within which the function operates. The syntax typically includes the `PARTITION BY` clause to divide the result set into partitions and the `ORDER BY` clause to define the order of rows within each partition.

The basic structure of a Window Function query in SQL looks like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    column1,
    column2,
    SUM(column3) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS running_total
FROM 
    table_name;
```

Here, the `SUM()` function is a Window Function that calculates a running total of `column3` within each partition defined by `column1` and ordered by `column2`.

    ```sql
    SELECT value_column, 
           SUM(value_column) OVER (ORDER BY date_column ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_sum_rows,
           SUM(value_column) OVER (ORDER BY date_column RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_sum_range
    FROM your_table;
    ```

- **Calculating Averages with ROWS versus RANGE:**
    - When using ROWS: The average will be calculated based on a fixed number of adjacent rows.
    - When using RANGE: The average will consider a range of values, which may result in varying numbers of rows being included based on the value distribution.
    ```sql
    SELECT value_column, 
           AVG(value_column) OVER (ORDER BY date_column ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_rows,
           AVG(value_column) OVER (ORDER BY date_column RANGE BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_range
    FROM your_table;
    ```

## Answer

### How Window Functions Work for Moving Averages and Cumulative Sums in SQL

Window functions in SQL enable powerful calculations across rows related to the current row, facilitating operations like ranking, running totals, moving averages, and cumulative sums. One common application of window functions is in calculating moving averages and cumulative sums.

#### Calculating Moving Averages with Window Functions
To calculate a moving average using window functions in SQL, you can define a window frame that determines the range of rows over which the average is computed. The window frame is specified using the `OVER` clause with `PARTITION BY` to group data and `ORDER BY` to define the logical order of rows for the moving average calculation.

The moving average formula using window functions can be expressed as:

$$ \text{Moving Average} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Value}_{i}}{n} $$

- **Value_{i}**: Value of the data point at index i within the window frame.
- **n**: Number of data points considered in the window frame.

### Code Snippet for Calculating Moving Average in SQL
```sql
SELECT date, value,
       AVG(value) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg
FROM your_table
ORDER BY date;
```

#### Calculating Cumulative Sums with Window Functions
For calculating cumulative sums using window functions, you do not need to explicitly define a window frame. The cumulative sum can be computed across all rows up to the current row, providing a running total of the values in the specified order.

The cumulative sum formula using window functions can be represented as:

$$ \text{Cumulative Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Value}_{i} $$

- **Value_{i}**: Value of the data point at index i within the cumulative sum calculation.

### Code Snippet for Calculating Cumulative Sum in SQL
```sql
SELECT date, value,
       SUM(value) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS cumulative_sum
FROM your_table
ORDER BY date;
```

### Advantages of Window Functions for Moving Averages
