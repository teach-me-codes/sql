{'Main question': 'What is a PRIMARY KEY constraint in SQL?', 'Explanation': 'The PRIMARY KEY constraint in SQL is used to uniquely identify each record in a database table. It enforces the uniqueness of the specified column or combination of columns and ensures that the values are always unique and not NULL.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does a PRIMARY KEY constraint differ from a UNIQUE constraint in SQL?', 'What are the benefits of using a PRIMARY KEY in database design and data integrity?', 'Can a table have multiple columns as part of the PRIMARY KEY constraint?']},

{'Main question': 'Explain the FOREIGN KEY constraint in SQL and its purpose.', 'Explanation': 'The FOREIGN KEY constraint in SQL establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table to a column in another table. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column match values in the primary key of the referenced table.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What actions can be specified on a FOREIGN KEY constraint for data integrity maintenance?', 'How does the FOREIGN KEY constraint prevent orphaned records and maintain consistency in relational databases?', 'Can a FOREIGN KEY constraint be defined between columns of different data types?']},

{'Main question': 'What is the significance of the UNIQUE constraint in SQL?', 'Explanation': 'The UNIQUE constraint in SQL ensures that all values in a column or a combination of columns are unique across the table. It allows for the enforcement of uniqueness without requiring the data to be the primary key.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does a UNIQUE constraint differ from a PRIMARY KEY constraint in terms of nullability?', 'Can a table have multiple UNIQUE constraints defined on different columns?', 'In what scenarios would you choose a UNIQUE constraint over a PRIMARY KEY constraint?']},

{'Main question': 'What does the NOT NULL constraint in SQL enforce?', 'Explanation': 'The NOT NULL constraint in SQL ensures that a column cannot have NULL values, meaning that every row must have a valid data entry for that column. It helps in maintaining data integrity and prevents the insertion of incomplete or missing information.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does the NOT NULL constraint impact data insertion and modification operations in SQL?', 'Can a column have both UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints simultaneously?', 'What are the implications of using the NOT NULL constraint on query performance and index usage?']},

{'Main question': 'Explain the purpose of the CHECK constraint in SQL and its usage.', 'Explanation': 'The CHECK constraint in SQL is used to limit the range of values that can be stored in a column. It ensures that data entered into the column meets specific conditions defined by the user, thereby restricting the values that can be inserted.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How is the CHECK constraint different from the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints in SQL?', 'What types of conditions or expressions can be used with a CHECK constraint?', 'Can multiple CHECK constraints be applied to a single column in a table?']},

{'Main question': 'How can SQL constraints be used together to enforce multiple rules on a table?', 'Explanation': 'SQL constraints can be combined to apply several rules to a table, ensuring data integrity and enforcing various conditions simultaneously. By utilizing PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints collectively, complex business rules can be enforced.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What considerations should be taken into account when applying multiple constraints to a table for data integrity?', 'How do constraints help in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data in a database?', 'Can constraints be modified or removed once they are applied to a table?']},

{'Main question': 'What are the potential performance implications of using constraints in SQL?', 'Explanation': 'Using constraints in SQL can impact the performance of database operations, especially during data insertion, modification, and retrieval. Constraints may require additional processing overhead to validate data and ensure compliance with defined rules.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can indexing be utilized to optimize query performance when constraints are applied to tables?', 'In what ways do constraints influence the execution plans of SQL queries?', 'What strategies can be employed to mitigate performance issues caused by constraints in large-scale databases?']},

{'Main question': 'How do SQL constraints contribute to maintaining data integrity in a relational database?', 'Explanation': 'SQL constraints play a vital role in preserving the integrity of the data stored in a relational database by enforcing rules and restrictions on the values that can be inserted or updated. They help in preventing data inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy and reliability.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the consequences of violating constraints on data integrity and overall database consistency?', 'Can constraints be temporarily disabled for specific operations in SQL?', 'How do constraints support the ACID properties of database transactions?']},

{'Main question': 'In what scenarios would you choose to use a CHECK constraint instead of a TRIGGER in SQL?', 'Explanation': 'CHECK constraints are preferred over triggers in SQL when data validation involves simple conditions that can be easily defined at the column level. Check constraints offer a more straightforward and declarative way to enforce data integrity rules directly within the table schema.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does the use of CHECK constraints enhance the readability and maintainability of database schemas compared to triggers?', 'What are the advantages of using triggers over CHECK constraints for complex data validation logic?', 'Can CHECK constraints be used to validate data based on values from other tables in SQL?']},

{'Main question': 'How do SQL constraints contribute to reducing errors and ensuring data consistency in database applications?', 'Explanation': 'By enforcing constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY, SQL helps in reducing data entry errors, maintaining consistency, and preventing data corruption in database applications. Constraints act as gatekeepers for data quality within the database.', 'Follow-up questions': ['In what ways do constraints impact the overall quality and reliability of database-driven applications?', 'How can constraints improve the efficiency and accuracy of data validation processes in database development?', 'What role do constraints play in supporting data governance and compliance requirements in organizations?']}
