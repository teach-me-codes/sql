    {
        'Main question': 'Explain the concept of lock escalation in SQL databases and its impact on resource utilization.',
        'Explanation': 'This question explores lock escalation, a process where a database system promotes multiple low-level locks to a higher-level coarser-grained lock to reduce overhead and contention.',
