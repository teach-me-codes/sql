    {
        'Main question': 'What is a table in the context of a database in SQL?',
        'Explanation': 'A table is a structured collection of data represented in rows and columns within a database, where each column defines a specific attribute and each row represents a single record. Tables are fundamental components for organizing and storing data in a relational database system.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How are tables used to establish relationships between different entities in a database design?', 'Can you explain the role of primary keys in ensuring data integrity within tables?', 'What considerations should be taken into account when designing efficient table structures for a database?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What is the significance of primary keys in a database table?',
        'Explanation': 'Primary keys are unique identifiers for each record or row within a table, enforcing data integrity by ensuring that each entry is distinct and serves as a reference point for establishing relationships with other tables. Primary keys play a crucial role in indexing and maintaining the relational integrity of the database schema.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does a primary key differ from a foreign key in terms of their roles within a database schema?', 'Can you discuss the concept of surrogate keys and their usage in scenarios where natural keys are not feasible or practical?', 'What are the best practices for selecting and defining primary keys when designing a database schema?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'How do foreign keys maintain referential integrity between database tables?',
        'Explanation': 'Foreign keys are columns that establish a link or relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table, ensuring consistency and integrity of data across related entities. Foreign keys enforce constraints that preserve the relational structure and prevent orphaned records in the database.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What actions are typically triggered in response to update or delete operations on foreign key-constrained columns?', 'Can you elaborate on the concept of cascading referential actions and their impact on data consistency in a database?', 'How can foreign key constraints be utilized to enforce business rules and maintain data integrity in a relational database system?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What role do indexes play in optimizing database performance in SQL?',
        'Explanation': 'Indexes are data structures that enable efficient retrieval of records by providing quick access to specific columns or combinations of columns in a table, speeding up query execution and reducing the overall workload on the database engine. Indexes enhance data retrieval speed by facilitating faster search and retrieval operations based on predefined criteria.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does the type of index (e.g., clustered, non-clustered) impact query performance and storage considerations in a database?', 'Can you discuss the trade-offs involved in creating indexes, considering factors like query optimization versus additional storage overhead?', 'What strategies can be employed to determine the most suitable columns for creating indexes based on query patterns and access patterns in a database schema?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What are constraints in SQL databases and how do they ensure data integrity?',
        'Explanation': 'Constraints are rules or conditions applied to columns or tables to enforce data integrity and maintain consistency in a database, preventing the insertion of invalid or inconsistent data. Constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints play a crucial role in defining and upholding data quality standards.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How do constraints like UNIQUE and CHECK constraints contribute to data validation and ensuring the correctness of data values stored in tables?', 'Can you explain the differences between table-level and column-level constraints in terms of their scope and impact on database operations?', 'What are the challenges associated with managing constraints when modifying existing database schemas or migrating data between environments?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'How can the concept of normalization improve database design and data integrity?',
        'Explanation': 'Normalization is a database design technique that minimizes redundancy and dependency by organizing data into multiple related tables connected through relationships. Normalization reduces data duplication, improves data integrity by avoiding anomalies, and enhances database efficiency by better structuring the relationships between entities.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the different normal forms in database normalization, and how do they help in achieving data consistency and minimizing data redundancy?', 'Can you explain the process of denormalization and when it might be considered in database design for performance optimization?', 'How does normalization support scalability and maintainability of a database system in the long run?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What is denormalization and when is it appropriate to denormalize a database schema?',
        'Explanation': 'Denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database schema to improve query performance and simplify data retrieval, often done to optimize read-heavy workloads. Denormalization aims to enhance query speed by reducing the need for joining multiple tables and aggregating data at query time.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the trade-offs involved in denormalization, such as increased storage requirements versus query performance gains?', 'Can you provide examples of scenarios where denormalization is beneficial and scenarios where it may lead to data inconsistencies or maintenance challenges?', 'How can denormalized databases be effectively managed to balance performance benefits with data integrity concerns over time?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'How does the concept of transaction management ensure data consistency in SQL databases?',
        'Explanation': 'Transactions are logical units of work that consist of one or more database operations, ensuring that all operations either succeed and commit changes or fail and are rolled back together to maintain data integrity. Transaction management mechanisms like ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) protect data from concurrent access and preserve database consistency.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the implications of different isolation levels (e.g., Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) on transaction behavior and data integrity in a multi-user database environment?', 'Can you discuss the role of transaction logs in ensuring data recoverability and maintaining consistency in the event of system failures or errors?', 'How do distributed transactions and two-phase commit protocols enhance data consistency in distributed database systems?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What are the common types of joins used in SQL queries, and how do they facilitate data retrieval across multiple tables?',
        'Explanation': 'Various types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) are operations that combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, enabling the extraction of meaningful information by linking data from different sources. Joins play a vital role in querying relational databases and retrieving data through specified associations.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does the choice of join type affect the result set and the inclusion of matching versus non-matching records in SQL queries?', 'Can you explain the differences between equi-joins and non-equijoins in terms of their join conditions and impact on query output?', 'What are the best practices for optimizing join performance and minimizing the potential for Cartesian products or performance bottlenecks in SQL queries?']
