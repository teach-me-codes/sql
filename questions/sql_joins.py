    {
        'Main question': 'What is an SQL JOIN and how does it work in database querying?',
        'Explanation': 'Explain the concept of SQL JOINs which are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Discuss the types of joins including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, and how they help retrieve data by matching or including rows from different tables.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['Can you provide an example scenario where an INNER JOIN would be used in a database query?', 'How does a LEFT JOIN differ from a RIGHT JOIN in terms of data retrieval?', 'When would you consider using a FULL JOIN to retrieve data from multiple tables?']

    {
        'Main question': 'What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL?',
        'Explanation': 'Define the disparities between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL queries. Explain how INNER JOIN retrieves rows only when there is a match in both tables, while OUTER JOIN includes unmatched rows from one or both tables based on the specified join condition.',

        'Follow-up questions': ['How would you troubleshoot a query with unexpected results stemming from a faulty JOIN condition?', 'What are the consequences of Cartesian products in SQL JOINs, and how can they be prevented?', 'Can you provide best practices for ensuring data integrity and consistency when performing JOIN operations across multiple tables?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'How do you decide which type of SQL JOIN to use in a given scenario?',
        'Explanation': 'Explain the thought process behind selecting the appropriate type of SQL JOIN based on the data retrieval requirements of a specific query. Consider factors such as the relationship between tables, the presence of matching or non-matching rows, and the desired output of the query.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the implications of choosing an INNER JOIN versus an OUTER JOIN when merging data from related tables?', 'In what situations would you opt for a CROSS JOIN over other types of JOINs in a SQL query?', 'How can you validate the accuracy of the query results when using different types of JOIN operations?']

    {
        'Main question': 'Can you provide a real-world example where SQL JOINs are essential for data analysis?',
        'Explanation': 'Illustrate a practical scenario where SQL JOINs play a crucial role in performing data analysis tasks. Describe how combining information from multiple tables using JOIN operations can help derive meaningful insights, make informed decisions, or generate comprehensive reports.',

        'Main question': 'What are some advanced techniques for SQL JOINs beyond basic INNER and OUTER JOINs?',
        'Explanation': 'Explore advanced strategies and techniques for SQL JOIN operations that go beyond the standard INNER and OUTER JOIN functionalities. This could include concepts like self join, non-equijoin, natural join, and cross apply, along with the best practices for applying these techniques in complex queries.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does a self join differ from other types of joins, and in what scenarios is it commonly used?', 'Can you compare and contrast the differences between a natural join and a cross join in terms of syntax and functionality?', 'What considerations should be taken into account when implementing a non-equijoin in a database query, and how does it affect query performance?']
