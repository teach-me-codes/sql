    {
        'Main question': 'What is a transaction in the context of SQL databases?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should explain the concept of a transaction as a series of operations that are executed as a single unit of work in SQL databases to ensure the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Transactions maintain data integrity by either committing all changes or rolling them back in case of failures.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['Can you elaborate on the ACID properties and their significance in transaction management?', 'How does the concept of Atomicity ensure that transactions are treated as indivisible units?', 'What measures are taken to achieve Consistency in database transactions?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'How are transactions started and ended in SQL databases?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should describe the mechanisms used to begin and terminate transactions in SQL databases, such as BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK statements. These commands initiate a transaction, save changes permanently, or rollback modifications to maintain data consistency.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the implications of not properly starting or ending a transaction in a database operation?', 'Can you discuss the role of SAVEPOINT in SQL transactions and its impact on data integrity?', 'When would a ROLLBACK statement be used in a transaction, and how does it affect the database state?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'Discuss the importance of the Isolation property in transaction management.',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should explain the significance of Isolation in transactions to ensure that concurrent execution of multiple transactions does not lead to data inconsistency or conflicts. Isolation levels like Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable control the visibility of changes made by other transactions.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How do different isolation levels impact the performance and data integrity in a multi-user database environment?', 'Can you explain the phenomena of dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads in the context of Isolation levels?', 'What challenges can arise when balancing Isolation levels for transaction consistency and system concurrency?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'Explain the concept of Atomicity and its role in maintaining data integrity.',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should define Atomicity as the property of transactions in SQL databases where either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully (commit) or none of them are applied (rollback). Atomicity ensures that transactions are executed entirely or not at all, preventing partial updates and inconsistencies.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does the failure of a single operation within a transaction affect the Atomicity property?', 'What mechanisms are in place to recover from transaction failures and maintain the Atomicity of database operations?', 'In what scenarios would the Atomicity property be crucial for preserving data consistency and reliability?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'How does the Durability property contribute to data persistence in SQL transactions?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should explain the role of Durability in ensuring that the changes committed during a transaction persist even in the event of system failures or crashes. Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the changes are saved permanently and can be recovered without data loss.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the mechanisms employed by database management systems to achieve Durability in transactions?', 'Can you discuss the trade-offs between achieving Durability and the system performance in database operations?', 'How does the Durability property impact the recovery processes in case of system failures or unexpected shutdowns?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'Describe the common challenges faced in transaction management within SQL databases.',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should address the typical problems encountered in transaction processing, such as deadlocks, long-running transactions, isolation anomalies, and maintaining ACID properties while ensuring high performance and scalability in database operations.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How can deadlocks be detected and resolved in a multi-transaction environment?', 'What strategies can be implemented to optimize transaction performance and mitigate the impact of long-running transactions?', 'In what ways do isolation anomalies like phantom reads affect the consistency and correctness of transaction results?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'Explain how Savepoints can be used in SQL transactions to manage partial rollback scenarios.',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should discuss the concept of Savepoints in transactions, allowing for creating named points within a transaction to which rollback can be performed without affecting the entire transaction. Savepoints provide flexibility in undoing changes selectively and handling contingencies in complex operations.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the advantages of using Savepoints in SQL transactions compared to full rollback operations?', 'Can you elaborate on nested transactions and their implications on Savepoint usage in database management?', 'How do Savepoints contribute to maintaining data consistency and transactional integrity during complex database operations?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'Discuss the role of Transactions in ensuring data consistency and reliability in modern database systems.',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should elaborate on how Transactions act as the fundamental unit for managing database operations by enforcing the ACID properties to maintain data integrity, prevent conflicts, and ensure reliable transaction outcomes even in concurrent environments with multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How do Transactions enable system recovery and rollback mechanisms in the presence of failures or errors during database operations?', 'Can you explain the concept of transaction logs and their significance in maintaining data consistency and recoverability?', 'What are the performance considerations when designing applications that heavily rely on transactional processing with ACID guarantees?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What are the impacts of transaction rollback on database consistency and application reliability?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should discuss the consequences of rolling back transactions in terms of reverting changes, ensuring data integrity, and preventing invalid or incomplete data updates. Transaction rollbacks play a critical role in maintaining the overall consistency of the database and the reliability of applications using the data.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How can partial rollbacks affect the consistency of data in complex transactional scenarios?', 'In what situations would a transaction rollback be preferred over committing changes to maintain database integrity?', 'What strategies can be employed to minimize the occurrence of transaction rollbacks and optimize transaction processing efficiency?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'Explain the differences between explicit and implicit transactions in SQL databases.',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should differentiate between explicit transactions initiated explicitly by BEGIN TRANSACTION and ended by COMMIT or ROLLBACK statements, and implicit transactions where actions are auto-committed after each operation. Understanding the distinctions between explicit and implicit transactions is essential for managing data consistency and transactional boundaries effectively.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the advantages of explicit transactions over implicit transactions in terms of control and data integrity?', 'How do implicit transactions impact the behavior of statements and their effects on database modifications?', 'Can you discuss the best practices for choosing between explicit and implicit transactions based on transaction complexity and atomicity requirements?']
